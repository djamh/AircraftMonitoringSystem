## Project Overview

This project is an Aircraft Monitoring System designed to track various parameters of an aircraft during flight.
It simulates and displays real-time data such as pressure, temperature, fuel levels, and their respective rates of change.

### Features

- Real-time monitoring of aircraft parameters:
  - Pressure
  - Temperature
  - Fuel Level
  - Altitude
  - Distance 
- Calculation of rate of change for the above parameters
- Smoke detection
- Interactive user options for additional data insights
